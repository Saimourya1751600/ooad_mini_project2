# Urban-Connect: A One-Stop Service Booking and Management Solution

Urban-Connect is a SaaS-based web application designed to streamline the process of booking and managing home services in urban areas. The platform connects customers with verified service providers, enabling seamless service discovery, booking, communication, and issue resolution — all under one roof.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Urban-Connect addresses the inefficiencies of the traditional home services industry by offering a centralized platform where:

- Customers can browse, book, and track services.
- Independent service providers can manage bookings and interact with clients.
- Administrators can oversee the entire ecosystem and ensure service quality.

This solution is built using modern web technologies including **ReactJS**, **Spring Boot**, and **MySQL**, providing a robust, scalable, and user-friendly experience.
