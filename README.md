# Urban-Connect: A One-Stop Service Booking and Management Solution

Urban-Connect is a SaaS-based web application designed to streamline the process of booking and managing home services in urban areas. The platform connects customers with verified service providers, enabling seamless service discovery, booking, communication, and issue resolution ‚Äî all under one roof.

## üöÄ Project Overview

Urban-Connect addresses the inefficiencies of the traditional home services industry by offering a centralized platform where:

- Customers can browse, book, and track services.
